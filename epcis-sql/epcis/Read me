Oliot EPCIS 1.2 supports  MySQL/Postgresql/MariaDB/Oracle

To start epcis:

Install MySQL/Postgresql/MariaDB/Oracle

Put the war file in {apache-tomcat-8.0.x}/webapps

start apache-tomcat


If you are using the source code and if you are using Oracle, 
Because of the oracle license restriction, 
there is NO public Maven repository which provides Oracle JDBC driver.
Therefore, you need to install it manually.

Get a help from the following site if u don't know how to install it:
