## Oliot EPCIS Second Generation ##

EPC Information Service (EPCIS) enables to capture and share standardized event/master data ratified by GS1. As an Auto-ID Labs. member [Auto-ID Labs.](https://autoidlab.kaist.ac.kr/people.html), we have been developed an open-source implementation of the standard since 2014. Oliot EPCIS v2.* has been developed from scratch again for high performance and retaining core functionality. The initial prototype is already implemented and available on a server at DFPL Lab. at Sejong University [DFPL Lab.] (https://sites.google.com/view/jack-dfpl/home). The system consists of several independent modules and we are in a finalizing step. The available module(s) is(are) as follows:

* **epcis-capture-xml**: The server implements a capture interface for Data Capture Applications (DCAs) to store EPCISDocument in a XML format into a persistent storage. 
* **epcis-query-soap**: The server implements a (part of) SOAP query interface for EPCIS Accessing Applications (EAAs) to retrieve events/master data in order to build applications. 
* **epcis-subscribe-soap**:The server implements a (part of) SOAP query interface for EPCIS Accessing Applications (EAAs) to subscribe an EPCIS system in order to deliver  events/master data periodically or on-demand.
* **epcis-capture-json**: The server implements a capture interface for Data Capture Applications (DCAs) to store EPCISDocument in a JSON format into a persistent storage.
* **epcis-query-rest**: The server implements a REST query interface for EPCIS Accessing Applications (EAAs) to retrieve events/master data in order to build applications or ubscribe an EPCIS system in order to deliver  events/master data periodically or on-demand. 

## Specification ##

* **Language**: Open JDK 19
* **Application Framework**: Eclipse Vert.x v4.3.7
* **Backend Storage**: MongoDB v6.0.3
