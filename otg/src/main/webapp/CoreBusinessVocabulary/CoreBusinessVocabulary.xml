							ownership.</attribute>
						<attribute id="urn:epcglobal:cbv:example">Retailer X unloads a pallet on to the

							The pallets are disaggregated from the shipping conveyance. The
							quantity is verified against the delivery document (Freight Bill
							or Bill of Lading), notating any over, short or damaged product
							at the time of delivery. Typically this process releases freight
							payment and completes the contractual agreement with the carrier
							of delivering the product/assets to a specified location.
						</attribute>
						<attribute id="urn:epcglobal:cbv:example">A parcel carrier drops off five boxes at

							In the
							case of a class-level identifier, commissioning differs from
